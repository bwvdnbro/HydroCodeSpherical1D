/**
 * @brief A simplified interface to the Unix system timer.

 * The Timer automatically registers the current system time when constructed
 * and returns the elapsed time in seconds when it is stopped.
 *
 * The Timer can also be used to time multiple intervals, by using the
 * functions Timer::start and Timer::stop. The function Timer::stop always
 * returns the total registered time, which is the sum of all individual
 * intervals measured.
